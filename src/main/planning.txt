 1. Algae intake button automatically chooses the correct algae height 
 based on which April tag (so it knows which side of the reef it's looking at)
 2. Operator preemptively 
 selects the setpoint,
 - one command 
 Drive presses intake or outtake button to trigger the height
 autoalign button brings elv up

 LT "Intake"
- if at low/high algae setpoint, EE intake ONLY IF not holding coral
- if at home position AND if NOT at algae setpoint, AND NOT holding coral/algae, EA go to loading setpoint then FN outtake and EE intake until EE has coral
- RT "outtake" if at barge setpoint OR if at coral L1 / L2 / L3 / L4 EE outtake
- LB "auto-align left"
- RB "auto-align right"
- LS - SW translation
- RS - SW w-velocity
Operator
A - L1
B - L2
C - L3
Y - L4

This only happens if EE has coral
