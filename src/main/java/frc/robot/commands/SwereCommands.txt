# SwereCommands.txt - swerve command factories
# (yes its misspelled in the actual code lol)

## requirements:
- provide factory methods for swerve commands
- keep code clean

## pseudocode:

SwereCommands class:

StrafeLeft():
  return new StrafeLeftCommand

StrafeRight():
  return new StrafeRightCommand

## notes:
- static factory pattern
- makes code more readable
- typo in class name but whatever
