# PassThroughCoralCommand.txt - pass coral through funnel

## requirements:
- shoot coral straight through funnel to end effector
- skip normal storage

## pseudocode:

PassThroughCoralCommand extends Command:

constructor:
  require funnel subsystem

initialize():
  set indexer to full speed

isFinished():
  return true when:
    - shallow beam break not broken
    AND
    - deep beam break IS broken
  // coral passed shallow but still at deep

end():
  stop funnel

## notes:
- used for direct handoff
- coral goes straight to end effector
- might not need this? commented out in robot container
- finishes at intermediate position
