# HoldCoralCommand.txt - hold coral in end effector

## requirements:
- keep coral from falling out
- run as default command
- don't interfere with algae

## pseudocode:

HoldCoralCommand extends Command:

constructor:
  require end effector subsystem

initialize():
  // nothing

execute():
  if holding algae:
    return
    // don't mess with algae
  
  if have coral:
    if beam break not triggered:
      run at hold speed
      // keep coral pulled in
    else:
      stop motor
      // already against beam break

end():
  stop motor

isFinished():
  return false
  // runs as default command

## notes:
- default command for end effector
- only runs when have coral
- gentle hold speed keeps it secure
- respects algae (doesn't interfere)
