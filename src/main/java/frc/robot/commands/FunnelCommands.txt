# FunnelCommands.txt - funnel command factories

## requirements:
- provide factory methods for funnel operations
- keep instantiation logic centralized

## pseudocode:

FunnelCommands class:

OuttakeCoral():
  return new OuttakeCoralCommand

IntakeCoral():
  return new IntakeCoralCommand

PassThroughCoral():
  return new PassThroughCoralCommand

## notes:
- static factory pattern
- makes RobotContainer cleaner
- easier to swap implementations if needed
