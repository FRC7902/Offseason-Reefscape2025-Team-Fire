# RobotContainer.txt - where all the robot stuff lives

## requirements:
- create all subsystems
- set up controllers and button bindings
- configure autonomous chooser
- set default commands

## pseudocode:

RobotContainer class:

static fields (so other classes can access):
  - funnelIndexerSubsystem
  - endEffectorSubsystem
  - elevatorSubsystem
  - armSubsystem
  - swerveSubsystem
  - driverController (PS5)
  - operatorController (PS5)

private fields:
  - autoChooser (for selecting auto routine)
  - various drive commands
  - intake/outtake command selectors

constructor:
  call configureBindings()
  call configurePathPlanner()
  build auto chooser and put on dashboard

configureBindings():
  set default commands:
    - swerve drives field-oriented
    - funnel intakes coral (unless already have it)
    - end effector holds coral
  
  driver controls:
    L1: auto-align left or center (depending if have coral)
    R1: auto-align right or center
    R2: outtake (varies by position)
    L2: intake (varies by position)
    dpad left/right: strafe commands
    options: zero gyro
    create: toggle fast drive mode
  
  operator controls:
    triangle/circle/square/cross: set elevator to L4/L3/L2/L1
    create: middle position
    dpad up/down: barge/processor positions
    dpad left/right: algae high/low positions
    options: center modules

coralHandoffCommand():
  parallel command that:
    - moves elevator to pickup
    - intakes coral through funnel
    - waits a bit
    - passes coral from funnel to end effector
    - moves to rest position
  only runs if dont already have algae

selectIntakeCommand:
  based on current elevator position:
    - if at algae position: intake algae
    - otherwise: run coral handoff

selectOuttakeCommand:
  based on current position:
    - if at coral positions: outtake coral
    - if at processor: outtake algae slower

configurePathPlanner():
  set up event triggers for auto:
    - elevator position events
    - intake/outtake events
    - auto-align events

getAutonomousCommand():
  return selected auto from chooser

## notes:
- this file is kinda messy ngl
- lots of conditional logic for intake/outtake
- button bindings might need tweaking
- pathplanner events let auto routines trigger commands
